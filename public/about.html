<h1>About Me</h1>
<p1>
  Hi! I’m Obed Goodluck Eze and I’m so excited to meet you
</p>


  <p>I’m a passionate, driven person who wants to do my part to make the world a better place.</p>

  <p>I love  creating mysteries out of nothing, read books and listen to inspiring messages.</p>

  <p>When I’m not working or doing what I love,
     my friends and
  family are the most important thing in my life.<br/>
  They mean the world to me.
  When they’re around, I feel like everything is possible.</p>

  <p>I’m currently in my final year of university, and it’s been 
    one of the most amazing years of my life so far.<br/>
 I’ve learned so much about myself and how to be a better person, 
which has made me feel more confident than ever before.
